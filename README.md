# Lilja's Arcade
Play all the games Lilja has made since she started coding... except the ones she didn't finish.

***NOTE!***
The main program(shown below) that runs games with a button click works by running shell scripts, 
so this will not work with Windows (and maybe not with MacOS), I've only tested this with Linux (Ubuntu). However you can still run each of the games on their own by running them with Java or Python3 in their corresponding directory

# Set Up
1. To play all games... make sure you have installed:
- Java 
- Python3
- Tkinter (for python3)
2. Clone this repository or download the project files
3. Compile Java files either by:
- Using the premade compile.sh executable OR
- Manually compiling all Java files found in Snake, Finger Dancer, Element Finder, and Gomoku

# Play
1. To run the main program simply type "java Main", in command line
2. To play a specific game, click on the game's icon on the main programs window
3. Keep track of how many games you play with the "Games Played" label at the top

***For instructions on how to play certain games, refer to the README.md in the game's directory. Have fun!***
